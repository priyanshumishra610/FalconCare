#  **FALCONCARE - HEALTH TECH WITH PURPOSE**

## 🌱 **WHY WE BUILT FALCONCARE**

> In rural India, the cost of asking for health advice can mean losing a day's wage.
> **FalconCare exists to change that — permanently and for everyone.**

We didn't build this to win a competition.
We built it because **Millions of Indians with feature phones still have no access to reliable, real-time health information.**
